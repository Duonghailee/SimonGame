# Vanila Javascript Simon Game
NOTE, this simon game is made by a lot of efforts as It is written only by pure/ vanila javascript.
As far as I know about javascript, i know that I don't know it at all. My respect and special thanks to Wojciech Kałużny

I have tried some version before with nest setTimeOut funct but none of them works perfectly, actually at first i tried put setInterval inside the 
loop and I hardly learn many things to this 'dangerous' async problem with setInerval 
I hope you enjoy the game

I build this game in order to complete the final front-end project in Freecodecamp.
Learning more about time event in Javascript, setTimeout, setInerval...
Drawing efficiently css object
Object design

# Features
How to play: 
- Simon game is a famous game which aims at practising your memory. In order to win the game, you need to pass 20 sequence color patterns.
- There are 2 modes: strict and non-strict mode. With Strict mode, everytime you enter the wrong color, a failure sound plays and the game ends and automatically starts again. By contrast, non-strict mode gives you the chance to re-see the color pattern again until you put it in right order.
- You can turn on/off the game any time you want.
